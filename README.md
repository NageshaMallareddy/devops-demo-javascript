Please note that you need to replace placeholders like your-docker-image-name and provide actual credentials for Docker Hub and Azure in your GitHub repository secrets.

Once you set up the CI/CD pipeline in your GitHub repository, it will automatically trigger a build and deploy the API to AKS whenever there is a push to the main branch.

Remember to make your AKS service public so that you can access it from the internet. You can use Kubernetes Services with type LoadBalancer to achieve this.

Please also note that the above example does not cover aspects like securing the API or database, managing secrets securely, or setting up networking and load balancing. In a real-world scenario, you should consider these factors to ensure the security and reliability of your application.

Finally, don't forget to configure DNS settings or obtain a public IP to access your API from the internet.
