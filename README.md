**Credentials**

Please note that you need to replace placeholders like your-docker-image-name and provide actual credentials for Docker Hub and Azure in your GitHub repository secrets.

**CI/CD Pipeline**

Once you set up the CI/CD pipeline in your GitHub repository, it will automatically trigger a build and deploy the API to AKS whenever there is a push to the main branch.

**Kubernetes**

Remember to make your AKS service public so that you can access it from the internet. You can use Kubernetes Services with type LoadBalancer to achieve this.

**Network Configuration**

Finally, don't forget to configure DNS settings or obtain a public IP to access your API from the internet.
